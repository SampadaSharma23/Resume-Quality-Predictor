# 📄 Resume Quality Predictor

The **Resume Quality Predictor** is a machine learning–based web application that predicts whether a resume is likely to receive a **callback from recruiters**.  
Users can select from multiple ML models and enter candidate details to get an instant prediction.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of **machine learning classification**, **model deployment**, and an **interactive user interface**.
